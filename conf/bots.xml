			An administrator block is identical to a <bot> block
			except for it the logchannel which is a required option.
			the staff channel and log channel are different options 
			in that staff channel is a channel the bot will idle in
			while as the logchannel will output all data messages
			about bot activity.

			Configurable options:
		
			Allowmodules   - A string of comma separated modules that this bot may use. Be warned,
			                 this setting will force all bots of this class to ONLY use allowed
			                 modules specificied by this setting, therefore it is an all or nothing 
			                 setting. However the any admin level module will ONLY be accessible
			                 to the Administrator connection.		
			                 
			Altnick        - This is the pattern that will be sent to the new
			                 nickname generator when the primary nickname cannot 
					         be used on IRC.

			Autojoin       - One time, on-logon triggered event that will automatically join 
						     to a comma separated valued list of channels, only triggered once
						     (eg: #chan1,#chan2,#etc3). 
			-->
			<autojoin>#vectra</autojoin>
			<!--			     
			Automodes      - These modes are the user modes assigned to the bot when a successfull
			                 read/write connection has been established to the server. This
			                 must be a valid IRC (usually server specific) mode string.

     		Bindip         - Network interface with which to connect to the server with. If
			                 this is not specified the OS will be left to handle it on its
			                 own. This option only allows for IPv4 or IPv4 IP's or hostnames.
			                 If you specify a hostname, Java will use whatever the default DNS
			                 settings are to attempt to resolve the hostname. This can also
			                 be a named interface "block" specified in the interface config.
			                 Settings in the interface block will be handled on their own, and 
			                 the Configuration system will handle each interface as per the 
			                 configuration.
			                 
			Clones         - Determines how many numeric copies should be spawned of this configuration.
							 Please remember that most networks implement session controls, etc to stop
							 exactly behavior like this... Note: This will not be read during an 
							 Administrator block
			
			Custom         - This is used to pass a custom configuration directive to the Bot (group).
			                 Because custom modules cannot be designed around the config file. The 
			                 custom declaration can be used to pass run time level information to the 
			                 config engine. a Module can then access this setting through the actual
			                 configuration. Be aware that this directive requires a key<->value
			                 representation and will be saved in a Map based on the specific key.

			Denymodules	   - This setting is independant of the Allowmodules because it is 
			                 checked first. Anything disallowed in here will not be allowed 
			                 during the processing of the ModuleHandler checking during the 
			                 Module process. Great for controlling which bots have access to 
			                 certain modules. 
			
			Ident          - The identity, also known as the ident. Used by the bot

			<!--
			Logchannel     - This channel acts much like a StaffChannel, the difference is
			                 it gives a separation between "Staff" and "Logging." The 
			                 Administrator connection will output ALL logging information 
			                 to this channel. If not set, it will default to the 
			                 'StaffChannel'. This setting maintains the same locked channel
			                 features that 'StaffChannel' has, therefore using both requires
			                 at least two channels wirth of space on the administrator 
			                 connection. This will not affect non-Administrators.

			Maxchannels    - Override the maximum channels. This value will be used only when
			                 it is smaller than the MAXCHANNELS value sent tin the RAW 005 
			                 message by the IRCd. This number should take into account the 
			                 StaffChannel and Logchannel especially for Administrator

			                 are configured by network, not by bot. This allows the

			Staffchannel   - A StaffChannel is better known as a mass idle channel. Whether
