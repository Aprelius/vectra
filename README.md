Vectra
======

The 'Vectra' project. culminating in over 5 years of work and more than 10,000 lines of code, the 
Vectra project was an IRC Stats bot based around the MMORPG game 'RuneScape'.

At it's height, Vectra served over 10,000 users primarily on the IRC network SwiftIRC. The project 
ended in 2011 due to financial issues, however I hope the software that was in development at the 
time can be a viable source of education for future IRC bot developers.

In the end the downfall of Vectra turned out to be it's scalability issues vs. maintaining an acceptable
cost margin for those of us supporting it. After Vectra closed I started working on the solution in hopes
of one day bringing the project alive in a different medium.

= The Vectra IRC Bot Project =
==============================

The Vectra project was started in 2006. Originally coded in the mIRC scripting language (msl)
the code was run in a stable platform environment for years until development stopped in late 2011.

I have continued development as a side project and hope that this will be an educational project
to teach up and comming bot makers or developers about sockets and protocol handling.
